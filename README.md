## SEO Upgrade/Modification

## Description
This is an update to a SEO Website to not affect the front-end performance/apperance of the website, but improve it within its structure.

## Installation
Extra equipment is not needed to view this project.

## Usage
I hope the updated model provides more structured and detailed code for future developers to work easier with down the line.
